## Creating & Modifying Icons

All Quintom assets are created using the free and open source vector graphics editor [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org), which is recommended for creating new icons or modifying existing ones.

While other tools exist that are suitable for SVG editing, they often add custom elements to extend the limitatations of standard SVG format, so they are not recommended.
